Sharks have been attacking humans for centuries and are responsible for many deaths. In fact, sharks kill an average of 50 people per year. Sharks are one of the most feared predators in the ocean, but they don’t often attack humans. In fact, there have only been X unprovoked shark attacks on humans since 2001 and only X deaths were caused by them.

This project analyses data on shark attacks from around the world to see if there are any patterns in where and when shark attacks occur. The data used for this project was collected from Maven Analytics. We hope that our findings will help people to better understand  when and where shark attacks are most likely to occur so that they can reduce their risk of being attacked.  


## Database
This [step-by-step tutorial](lowcodedatagirl.medium.com) will show you how to set up MySQL Server, MySql Workbench, and import your first dataset.

- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
- [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

## Dataset
There is a single table with X rows and 17 columns in the Shark Attacks Dataset. 

## Dataset Schema 
Shark Attacks

All columns in this table have a data type of Varchar(50) , meaning that they can each store values up to 50 characters long.

- Case Number             
- Date 
- Year 
- Type 
- Country 
- Area
- Location 
- Activity 
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Injury
- Fatal (Y/N)
- Time
- Species
- Investigator or Source
- pdf 
- href formula
- href
- Case Number_[0]
- original order

## SQL Skills Used 

- Joins
- Stored Procedures
- Subqueries 


## Data Insights 

- Make a graph of number of shark attacks annually over time since 1900. What trends do you see?

- Which countries report the most shark attacks? Within those countries, which areas and locations seem to be the most dangerous?

- What body parts are most often injured? (hint: you'll need to perform text analysis on the Injury column)

- Are shark attacks more common during certain parts of the day (again, the Time data isn't quite ready to go. You may need to transform it before analyzing)

- Which species of shark are attacking most often? (you guessed it... this data is messy too!)

## Documentation


A step-by-step guide is included in this [documentation](lowcodedatagirl.medium.com), as well as detailed information about the analysis process.
