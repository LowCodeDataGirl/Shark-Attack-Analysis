# Shark-Attack-Analysis
This query contains queries used to clean and analyze the Shark Attacks dataset from Maven analytics 



## Database
This [step-by-step tutorial](lowcodedatagirl.medium.com) will show you how to set up MySQL Server, MySql Workbench, and import your first dataset.

- [MySQL Workbench](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/workbench/)
- [MySQL Community Server](https://dev.mysql.com/downloads/mysql/)

## Dataset
There is a single table with X rows and 17 columns in the Shark Attacks Dataset. 

## Dataset Schema 
Shark Attacks

All columns in this table have a data type of Varchar(50) , meaning that they can each store values up to 50 characters long.

- Type 
- Country 
- Area
- Location 
- Activity 
- Name
- Sex
- Age
- Injury
- Fatal (Y/N)
- Time
- Species
- Investigator or Source
- pdf 
- href formula
- href
- Case Number_[0]
- original order

## SQL Skills Used 

- Joins
- Stored Procedures
- Subqueries 


## Data Insights 

- Make a graph of number of shark attacks annually over time since 1900. What trends do you see?

- Which countries report the most shark attacks? Within those countries, which areas and locations seem to be the most dangerous?

- What body parts are most often injured? (hint: you'll need to perform text analysis on the Injury column)

- Are shark attacks more common during certain parts of the day (again, the Time data isn't quite ready to go. You may need to transform it before analyzing)

- Which species of shark are attacking most often? (you guessed it... this data is messy too!)

## Documentation


A step-by-step guide is included in this [documentation](lowcodedatagirl.medium.com), as well as detailed information about the analysis process.
